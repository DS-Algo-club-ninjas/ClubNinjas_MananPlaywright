- text: "Generated at: 11:16:31 PM **1. TRIAGE LEVEL: MEDIUM** **Clinical Justification:** The patient's chief complaints of cold and cough, alongside flu-like symptoms, indicate a viral respiratory illness, which is common and generally self-limiting. However, without vital signs available, there is uncertainty regarding potential complications or severity, which necessitates further evaluation. The absence of a significant medical history and current medications also suggests that this patient does not have any acute complications or a high risk of deterioration, placing her in a medium triage category. **2. TOP 3-5 POSSIBLE DIAGNOSES, ranked by likelihood:** 1. **Viral Upper Respiratory Infection (URI) / Influenza:** Most likely given symptoms of cold and cough; flu-like symptoms suggest a viral etiology. 2. **Acute Bronchitis:** Possible if cough is persistent and associated with sputum production. Often follows a viral infection. 3. **Allergic Rhinitis:** Could present similarly, but less likely given the acute onset and flu-like nature of her symptoms. 4. **COVID-19:** Consideration necessary pending further symptom clarification and testing, though more information is needed. 5. **Pneumonia:** Less likely but could be a concern if cough worsens, especially with fever and shortness of breath. **3. Key clinical concerns and risk factors:** - Risk of progression to pneumonia, especially if cough worsens or associated with fever. - Potential for secondary bacterial infection following a viral illness. - History of allergic conditions may exacerbate respiratory symptoms. - Current vital signs are unknown, which could mask underlying respiratory distress. **4. Immediate actions/interventions needed:** - Assess vital signs: heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation to gauge severity. - Symptomatic treatment: Recommend hydration, rest, and potentially over-the-counter medications (antipyretics or cough suppressants). - Monitor for escalating symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, high fever, or chest pain. **5. Recommended diagnostic tests:** - Rapid Influenza Diagnostic Test (RIDT) to confirm or rule out influenza. - COVID-19 PCR or antigen test based on guidelines and local protocols, especially if respiratory symptoms are pronounced. - Basic lab tests, including a complete blood count (CBC), if symptoms worsen, or there are signs of bacterial infection. - Chest X-ray if there are concerns about pneumonia or significant respiratory distress. **6. Specialist referral recommendations:** - Referral to a primary care physician or an infectious disease specialist if symptoms persist or worsen after initial management. - Consider allergy specialist referral if allergic rhinitis is suspected based on history and symptom patterns. **7. Warning signs requiring escalation:** - Development of high fever (≥ 101°F), significant shortness of breath, or respiratory distress. - Persistent cough with production of discolored sputum or hemoptysis. - Signs of dehydration (e.g., decreased urine output, dizziness). - Any new onset of confusion or lethargy, indicating potential systemic involvement or sepsis."
